# Macaulay2 in JupyterLab (GitHub Codespaces)

This repository provides a ready-to-use GitHub Codespace that runs

No local installation is required — everything runs in your browser.

## Quick start

1. Click **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main**
2. Wait for the environment to build (it takes a few minutes -- grab a sandwich 🥪)
3. Once it has built, go to https://github.com/codespaces, find your codespace, click the ⋯, and select **Open in JupyterLab**
4. Click the M2 icon to start a notebook and start coding!
